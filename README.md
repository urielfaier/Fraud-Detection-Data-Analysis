# Fraud Detection Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a comprehensive data analysis focused on detecting and managing fraud within a company's dataset. Through meticulous examination and application of statistical methods, the project reveals insights into fraud trends, evaluates risk factors, and proposes strategies to mitigate fraud risks.

## Project Structure

- `Data_Analysis_Fraud_Detection.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all analysis steps, visualizations, and insights.
- `dataset.xlsx`: The dataset used for the analysis.

## Key Objectives

1. **Threshold Analysis**: Establish a decline threshold to achieve a 90% approval rate, using classification scores.
2. **Model Score Visualization**: Visualize the distribution of classification scores to understand model performance.
3. **Fee Percentage Calculation**: Determine the necessary fee percentage to balance fee revenue with chargeback costs.
4. **Dynamic Fee Calculation**: Develop a function to calculate fee percentages dynamically for varying data samples.
5. **Chargeback Proportions Analysis**: Analyze and visualize chargeback proportions across different order sources.
6. **AVS Mismatch Analysis**: Investigate the impact of address verification system (AVS) mismatches on fraud risk.
7. **Monthly and Weekly Trends**: Examine chargeback rates on monthly and weekly bases to identify temporal patterns.
8. **Customer Account Age Analysis**: Explore the relationship between customer account age and chargeback rates.
